# estimation_of_obesity levels
in this project we want to find a good model for estimation_of_obesity levels. we will check RandomForestClassifier and DecisionTreeClassifier and KNeighborsClassifier to figure out which one is better.
# dataset information
The attributes related with eating habits are: Frequent consumption of high caloric food (FAVC), Frequency of consumption of vegetables (FCVC), Number of main meals (NCP), Consumption of food between meals (CAEC), Consumption of water daily (CH20), and Consumption of alcohol (CALC). The attributes related with the physical condition are: Calories consumption monitoring (SCC), Physical activity frequency (FAF), Time using technology devices (TUE), Transportation used (MTRANS), other variables obtained were: Gender, Age, Height and Weight. Finally, all data was labeled and the class variable NObesity was created with the values of: Insufficient Weight, Normal Weight, Overweight Level I, Overweight Level II, Obesity Type I, Obesity Type II and Obesity Type III.
attribute:
ins -> Insufficient Weight

normal -> Normal Weight

obe1 -> Obesity Type I

obe2 -> Obesity Type II

obe3 -> Obesity Type III

over1 -> Overweight Level I

over2 -> Overweight Level II
